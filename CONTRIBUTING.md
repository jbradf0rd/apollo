# Contributing to Apollo

Thanks for your interest! Apollo (a fork of OpenSidekick, now Hermes-driven) is intentionally simple: plain ES modules,
no build step, no runtime dependencies. That makes it easy to hack on.

## Getting set up

1. Clone the repo.
2. Load it as an unpacked extension at `chrome://extensions` (Developer mode →
   Load unpacked).
3. Make changes and hit the reload icon on the extension card to pick them up.
   Reload the target page after changing `content-script.js`.

## Before opening a PR

```bash
npm run check   # syntax-checks every JS file as an ES module
npm run shots  # regenerate the README screenshots (relay port must be free)
```

Please:

- Keep the no-build, no-dependency constraint. If a change needs a build tool,
  open an issue to discuss first.
- Match the existing style (2-space indent, ES modules, descriptive comments
  that explain _why_, not _what_).
- Keep provider code protocol-agnostic — new hosted services that speak
  OpenAI's `/chat/completions` should work by adding a preset in
  `src/common/constants.js`, not new code.
- Don't add analytics, telemetry, or any phone-home behavior. Privacy is a core
  promise of this project.

## Good first issues

- New provider presets (verify the base URL and default model).
- Improving the page-reading heuristics in `content-script.js`.
- Better Markdown rendering in the side panel.
- Accessibility and keyboard-navigation improvements in the UI.

## Architecture at a glance

The agent loop lives in `src/background/agent.js`. It calls the model
(`providers.js`), executes any tool calls (`tools.js` + `content-script.js`),
gates mutating actions (`permissions.js`), and streams events to the side panel.
Start there to understand how a task runs end to end.

## Reporting bugs

Include your Chrome version, the provider/model you used, the site you were on
(if shareable), and the steps to reproduce. Console logs from the service worker
(`chrome://extensions` → Inspect views: service worker) are very helpful.
