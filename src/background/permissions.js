// Per-site permission logic. The agent must be granted access to act on a site.
//
// Model:
//   - Reads (read_page / get_page_text) are allowed on any site the user is
//     actively looking at — they don't modify anything.
//   - Mutating actions (click, type, select, navigate, submit) require the
//     origin to be "allow"-listed. The first such action on a new origin
//     triggers a user prompt (Allow once / Always allow / Decline), UNLESS
//     autonomy is "auto" and the origin isn't already blocked.
//   - Sensitive categories (banking, payments, crypto) always require an
//     explicit per-action confirmation and cannot be "always allowed".
